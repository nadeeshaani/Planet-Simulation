# Force of Attraction
    - Know that gravity is relative to different objects
    - All the objects are attracting one another, and the force of this attraction depends on their masses.
    - This relationship is given by the equation, (Force of attraction between two objects)

        - By examining it you can see, the distance between them affects this force more than their masses.
        - The further away these masses are the lower the attraction will be. And wise versa.
